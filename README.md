## HTML

Create a responsive layout with the following properties:

1) Fixed position header and footer which span the entire width of the page.
2) 4 columns for desktop resolutions, 2 columns for portrait tablet, and 1 column for phone.
3) Column 1 should contain an ordered list of 10 items with alternating background colors.
4) Column 2 should contain a div with 5px rounded corners.
5) Column 3 should contain a div with horizontally and vertically centered text which spans multiple lines.
6) Column 4 should contain and image which takes up the full width of the column.
7) Cross-browser compatible.  IE9+.  Graceful degradation for IE8 where appropriate.

This should represent production-ready code, so show us code you would be proud to deploy.
Do not worry about the design looking pretty, we just want to see the code.

## JS

Using JS and HTML, create a version of the game Hangman (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)).
The game can generally be implemented however you want but should adhere to the following:

1) Start game by entering a word into a text box.
2) Display an underscore for each letter of the word.
3) Enter a letter guess into another textbox and submit by clicking a button.
4) Whenever a correct guess is made, reveal the letter in the word by replacing the corresponding underscore.
5) Whenever a wrong guess is made, draw another piece of the hangman.  To save time, you can just decrement a "Remaining Guesses" counter instead of actually drawing a hangman.
6) If you guess the word display a "You win!" alert, otherwise display a "You lose!" alert.

This should represent production-ready code, so show us code you would be proud to deploy.
